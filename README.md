Dollar_Drop is a simple program capable of finding retail arbitrage oppurtunities in a specific, unnamed, low priced department store.  Any implied affiliations with said store are purely coincidental, and no relationship exists between the creators of this program and this hypothetical department store.

This program is not valid with the following stores:

  - Petsmart
  - Kmart
  - Deal Mart

Nor is it valid with any other stores that share similar endings or pronounciation.
